<!--This section is style which changes the way the table is sized. We only needed it to be 50% of the page so we call on the table to be resized down to 50%.-->

<h1>TABLE OF CONTEMPLATION</h1>
<!-- This is the code for the header of the table, a simple h1 with opening and closing calls.-->

		<td>Excellence is a habit: "From this day on I'd like to be known as 'The Big Aristotle' because Aristotle once said, 'Excellence is not a singular act; it's a habit. You are what you repeatedly do'"</td>
		<td> Shaquille O'Neal</td>
		<td> <img src="Shaq.jpg" alt="Shaq"></td>
<!-- I used Shaq for my quote and so I created the 3 rows for his quote, his name and his image that represents his quote. While also adding a source for the image so the page can grab the image and open it up when called upon.-->
